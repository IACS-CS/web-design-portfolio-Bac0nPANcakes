<p>Remember those choose-your-own-adventure books? Translate that into 
basic HTML coding, and you get this project! My adventure is based on 
Lobotomy Corporation, a psychological horror game made by Project Moon,
a small group of indie game developers in South Korea. This project is 
still a work in progress because I got overambitious because of my 
excitement about working on it. I had all these ideas and not enough
free time to finish it.

<p>Inspired by David Shea's Zen Garden that showed off how much you 
can do with only a cascading style sheet, time to actually do the thing, 
and a dream. My garden is space themed and is really pretty.</p>
